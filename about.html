				<h3>Be Selective</h3>
				<p>
					<img src="assets/images/mac.jpg" alt=""
						class="img-rounded pull-right" width="300"> Be selective
					about what you choose to focus your energy on. Your time is
					precious, so be cautious about who you choose to spend your time
					with, and what you choose to spend your time on. Working with
					technology, it’s almost like everyone has a good idea for an app or
					website. learn to say no more, so that you can focus exclusively on
					the handful of things you want to finish before the day is out.
				</p>
				<p>“Decide on your most important task. Begin immediately and
					work on that task with self-discipline until it is 100% complete.
					In life, all success comes from completing tasks. It’s not from
					working at tasks, it’s from completing tasks. It is only when you
					complete tasks that you become successful.” – Brian Tracy</p>
				<h3>Commit</h3>
				<p>Now that you’ve planned how you’re going to finish your small
					list of projects, and you’ve figured out when you are going to work
					on it, make sure you do it. Each day,tick off which ever one you’ve
					written. This means you don’t get lost brainstorming when you're
					supposed to be finishing tasks. If your goal was to launch a side
					hustle, commit to spending a few hours each week (or whatever you
					can spare) and stick to it.</p>
				<h3>Track Your Progress</h3>
				<p>I once read an article about how having a “done list” is just
					as important as having a “to do list” and I would agree. Sometimes,
					when you’ve been working hard on something for a long time, you
					don’t see all the work you’ve done — just the work that remains.
					Every now and again, look at the archived items in Trello, or the
					done items in Wunderlist. You’ll start to appreciate how much
					you’ve done, and will hopefully lift some of the fatigue that goes
					along with working on the same project for a long time.</p>
				<h3>Have The End Goal In Mind</h3>
				<p>What does “finished” look like? Is it a live deployment? A
					certain number of subscribers or users? Is it to read a specific
					number of books? The best way to tell if you’re really finished a
					project is to have a finish line. That will differ depending on a
					huge variety of factors, but if you can think about what success
					looks like, it will give you a clear target to aim at. This will
					make completing tasks a lot easier. When you have an end goal in
					mind, it’s also important to track your progress.</p>
