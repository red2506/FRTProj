				<p>It can be hard to change your eating habits. It helps to
					focus on small changes. Making changes to your diet may also be
					beneficial if you have diseases that can be worsened by the things
					you eat or drink. Symptoms from conditions such as kidney disease,
					lactose intolerance, and celiac disease can all benefit from
					changes in diet. Below are suggestions to improve your health. Be
					sure to stay in touch with your doctor so he or she knows how you
					are doing.</p>
				<p>Find the strengths and weaknesses in your current diet. Do
					you eat 4-5 cups of fruits and vegetables every day? Do you get
					enough calcium? Do you eat whole grain, high-fiber foods? If so,
					you’re on the right track! Keep it up. If not, add more of these
					foods to your daily diet.</p>
				<p>Keep track of your food intake by writing down what you eat
					and drink every day. This record will help you assess your diet.
					You’ll see if you need to eat more or less from certain food
					groups.</p>

				<h2>Things to consider</h2>
				<p>Balanced nutrition and regular exercise are good for your
					health. These habits can help you lose or maintain weight. Try to
					set realistic goals. They could be making some of the small diet
					changes listed above or walking daily.Doctors and dietitians
					suggest making healthy eating habits a part of daily life rather
					than following fad diets. Nutrition tips and diets from different
					sources can be misleading. Keep in mind the advice below, and
					always check with your doctor first.</p>
				<p>Fad diets aren’t the answer. Fad or short-term diets may
					promise to help you lose weight fast. However, they are hard to
					keep up with and could be unhealthy.</p>

				<blockquote>
					“It is health that is real wealth and not pieces of gold and
					silver.” <br> “When diet is wrong, medicine is of no use. When
					diet is correct, medicine is of no need.” <br> “Let food be
					thy medicine, thy medicine shall be thy food.” – Hippocrates,
					Ancient Greek physician
				</blockquote>
				<p>Choose products that list whole grains as the first
					ingredient. For example, whole grain breads or whole-wheat flour.
					Whole grains are low in fat and high in fiber. They also contain
					complex carbohydrates (carbs), which help you feel full longer and
					prevent overeating. Avoid products that say “enriched” or contained
					with other types of grains or flours. They do not have the same
					nutrients.</p>
				<p>Hot and cold cereals usually are low in fat. However, instant
					cereals with cream may contain high-fat oils or butterfat. Granola
					cereals also may have high-fat oils and extra sugars. Look for
					low-sugar options instead.</p>

				<h3>Fruits and Vegetables</h3>
				<p>Fruits and vegetables naturally are low in fat. They provide
					flavor and variety to your diet. They also contain necessary fiber,
					vitamins, and minerals. Try not to add unneeded fats to vegetables
					and fruits. This means avoiding margarine, butter, mayonnaise, and
					sour cream. You can use yogurt, healthy oils, or herbs to season
					instead.</p>
				<p>Select low-fat, lean cuts of meat. Lean beef and veal cuts
					have the words “loin” or “round” in their names. Lean pork cuts
					have the words “loin” or “leg” in their names. Trim off the outside
					fat before cooking it. Trim any inside, separable fat before eating
					it. Use herbs, spices, and low-sodium marinades to season meat.</p>
